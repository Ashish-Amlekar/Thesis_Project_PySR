It is a multiplicative combination of terms reflecting identified proportionalities:\n- **(1 - Sratio^A)**: Supported by `Fortini_2017.md` (Equation 11: `\u03b4d = \u0394[1 \u2212 (d/dav)^(2\u2212\u03b1)]`, where `(d/dav)` is `Sratio` and `(2-\u03b1)` is `A`, empirically found to be ~1.87) and `Wolf_2025.md` which states particle velocity is proportional to `d^2` leading to velocity differences dependent on `(Sratio)^2`.\n- **(1/Wf)**: Directly stated as `Phor\u221dWf**\u22121` in `Explanation_updated.md` and consistent with `Wolf_2025.md` observing that higher particle concentrations reduce segregation.\n- **Fs**: Directly stated as `Phor\u221dFs` in `Explanation_updated.md` and supported by `Fortini_2017.md` indicating strong segregation with high small particle concentration. `C` and `A` are constants to be determined."
